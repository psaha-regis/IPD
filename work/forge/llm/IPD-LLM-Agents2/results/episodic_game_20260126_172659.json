After each period, you can reflect on \nwhat happened and adjust your approach. Learn from experience to improve your \noutcomes over time.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT - THIS IS MANDATORY:\nFirst, provide your reasoning in 2-3 complete sentences:\n- What patterns do you observe in the recent interactions?\n- Why are you choosing to cooperate or defect?\n- What outcome do you expect?\n\nIn your reasoning, use lowercase words (\"cooperate\", \"defect\") when discussing options.\n\nThen, you MUST end your response with EXACTLY one of these words on its own line:\nCOOPERATE\nor\nDEFECT\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n- You MUST make a definite choice - no hedging, no \"maybe\", no conditional statements\n- The final line must contain ONLY the word COOPERATE or ONLY the word DEFECT\n- Nothing else on that line - no punctuation, no additional words\n- This is a game-theoretic requirement: both players must commit to definite actions\n\nCORRECT EXAMPLE:\n\"We've both cooperated for three rounds and earned 3 points each time. This \nmutual cooperation is working well. I'll continue cooperating.\n\nCOOPERATE\"\n\nINCORRECT EXAMPLES:\n\"I might cooperate\" - NO: must be definite\n\"COOPERATE or DEFECT\" - NO: must choose one\n\"I'll COOPERATE this time\" - NO: decision must be on its own line\n\"COOPERATE.\" - NO: no punctuation on decision line\n\"My choice is COOPERATE\" - NO: decision word must be alone on the line\n\nDO NOT just write a single word like \"cooperate\" or \"defect\" as your reasoning. \nAlways explain your thinking in complete sentences, then provide your action.\n",
